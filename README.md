## Scripts and Files
- convert_RGB_to8bit_.ijm
  - Fiji script used to preprocess data micro-sam which requires 8-bit images as input for the finetuning
- Make_overlays_labelMap_.ijm
  - Fiji cript to convert labelmaps to Fiji ROIs and overlay images from a set of images.
- Make_PDX_montages_.ijm
  - Fiji script to make a image montage of images in batch
- randomImages.py
  - Python script to extract random images from the data sets for training micro-sam
- sam_finetuning_own.ipynb
  - Jupyter notebook which contains all code for finetuning of our spheroid segmentation models, run predictio on the data sets and accompanying script to extract measurements from
- environment.yml
  - Conda environment file used to run the jupyter notebook

To initiate the conda environment based on the `environment.yml` file, use the following command:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml -n micro-sam
conda activate micro-sam
jupyter notebook
```
